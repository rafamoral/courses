The required software for this workshop is all free and open source
and will run identically on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms.

There are a few pieces of software to install:

-   [R](https://www.r-project.org/): An environment for statistical
    computing.
-   [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/): An integrated development
    environment for using R.
-   [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/): A bundle of R packages to
    use R the modern way, and including `ggplot2`.
-   Additional packages to work with `ggplot2`
-   [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/): To make high quality reports with RMarkdown, we need to use LaTeX, which is software that is external to R. Unless you already use LaTeX, the easiest thing to do to use LaTeX in R is to install `tinytex`.

## Installing R

Go to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) website and follow the links
for downloading. On Windows, this should lead you to

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.

Downloading this and following the usual Windows installation process,
you\'ll then have a full working version of R.

On Macs, the installation procedure is essentially identical. The latest
Mac installer should be available at

-   <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>.

Download this and follow the usual Mac installation process to get a
full working version of R for Macs.

## Installing Rstudio

Using Rstudio is not strictly necessary. You can do all you need to do
with R without using Rstudio. However, many people have found that using
R is more convenient and pleasant when working through Rstudio. To
install it, go to the [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website,
specifically to

-   <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

which will list all the available installers. Note that you just want
the Rstudio *desktop* program. The Rstudio *server* is something else
(basically it is for providing remote access to Rstudio hosted on Linux
servers).

Again, you\'ll just follow the usual installation process for Windows or
Macs to install Rstudio using these installers.

## Installing the tidyverse packages

The so-called [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a collection of
interrelated R packages that implement essentially a new standard
library for R. In other words, the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) gives us a bundle tools for
doing commonplace data manipulation and visualization and programming.
It represents the modern way to use R, and in my opinion, it\'s the best
way to use R. All the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages
can be installed by typing the following command in R:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The main packages that are contained within the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) bundle are listed
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

## Additional packages

We will use a few other packages, which you can install by executing:

```r
install.packages(c("ggExtra", "cowplot", "ggrepel", "ggpubr"))
```

## Installing LaTeX using `tinytex`

Unless you already use LaTeX and have it installed already, the easiest thing to do is to install `tinytex` as follows.
```r
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
This installation will take some time. After it completes, you should restart RStudio.
After you restart, type the following command (note the three `:`'s):
```r
tinytex:::is_tinytex()
```

Test that rmarkdown (which will have be installed by `tidyvese`) will render pdf documents using LaTeX with the following code.
```r
writeLines("Hello $x^2$", 'test.Rmd')
rmarkdown::render("test.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")
```
If that worked, you should have a pdf document named `test.pdf` in your working directory.
